Welcome to Hytheria! This guide walks you through the first hour on the server.

## Step one: Claim your island

Speak with the **Island Steward** in the hub to claim your personal sky island.

## Step two: Gear up

- Complete the starter questline.
- Craft your first enchanted tools.
- Sell excess loot at the bazaar to build coin reserves.

## Step three: Join a crew

Co-op islands advance faster. Invite friends with the `/coop invite` command.
