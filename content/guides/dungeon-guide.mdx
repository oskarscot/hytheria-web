Dungeons are the fastest way to earn relics and rare materials, but they demand preparation.

## Before you enter

- Bring a party with mixed roles.
- Equip at least one crowd-control ability.

## Boss tips

The Obsidian Warden charges after each roar. Keep moving and punish during the cooldown window.
