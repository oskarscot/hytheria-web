Our first content drop is live with new automation tools, boss drops, and quality-of-life adjustments.

## Highlights

1. **Forge Minions** to automate ore processing.
2. **Dungeon Relics** now drop from the Obsidian Warden.
3. **Quest Board** now shows recommended power level.

We will keep tuning drop rates and balancing the economy — keep feedback flowing in Discord.
