SkyBlock has been updated to version `0.0.10` fully introducing sprinklers and their attachments as well as farming minions.

![New Minion Tools](/images/news/minion.png)

## Highlights

1. **Sprinklers** which will automatically water your crops.
2. **Sprinkler Upgrades** which change the water capacity and how far can the sprinkler reach.
3. **Minions** which will automatically harvest your crops.
4. **Server Update** to Hytale Version 3

### Sprinklers

These are craftable at the Farming Station, with a new model and 3 upgrade slots Nozzle (coverage), Tank (water capacity), Filter (water efficiency).

### Minions

Place a Farming Minion on your island and let it harvest crops while you're AFK. It plants, picks, and stores - all on its own. 
It's craftable at the Farming Station and automatically harvests mature crops in range and stores the loot, you can load seeds into 3 seed slots to auto-replant
and has 5 upgrade tiers which all boost the speed, radius and storage. You can collect items, claim stored XP or pick it up and move it at any time.

### NPC Overhaul

NPCs got a bit of an overhaul with new UI displaying the NPC's Quests, Shop and any special abilities they may have. We also brought in a new questline aimed at beginners
to help them get used to the server. You can claim your quest rewards from the NPCs as they all have unique questlines.

As you can see the Blacksmith has a special ability to repair items, the new system allows us to add custom interactions to any NPC.

This is all for this update, happy farming!
